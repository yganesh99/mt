				'Aka aye sinamika, low Budget pooja hedge,the lifeline of masala thoughts, needs constant validation Like this to make her do the edit, Post and pay for the Podcast app ü§£ La la Land Girl Living the Tamil meme Life in her own olulu world, lame puns and forgetting every Tamil Song Lyric explains mika the best. Easily triggered when you bring the Gender Card, which turns the gvm heroine into a vetrimaaran Heroine. It‚Äôs always a hope or rope for our pooja, but if you ever need help with your smart phone or life , she‚Äôs the one you call cuz that‚Äôs the only jeevan that will answer. Aye sinamika a Twitter celeb is also known to get serupadi on Twitter from vijaykanth fans to Vijay fans. All area layum akka adi vangada edam illa. Varta mama durrrr.',

				'The queen of actual facts. Effortlessly juggles married life, a full-time marketing job, and her inner Kollywood‚ÄìCSK fangirl like a total pro. Knows everything, does everything‚Äîeven has questionable celebrity encounters (like definitely not touching Trisha‚Äôs hair strand). Once hosted a Super Singer show‚Ä¶ from AliExpress. Saintly on the outside, but somehow knows everyone and every single gossip. Official Thalaivi of the Ceylon Thalapathy Rasigar Mandram, currently busy manifesting her voting rights for TVK 2026.',

			role: 'Certified Aamai & Depressed Arsenal Fan & Yapper Machine',
			description:
				'No, his parents were not inspired by Sai Baba. Calls himself a ‚Äúgreen forest‚Äù and honestly, that‚Äôs just the beginning. Certified yapper who absolutely cannot stand losing an argument‚Äîand will not stop until you give in. Meme lord by day, unofficial mimicry artist by night (his S. Janaki and Venu Chakravarthy impressions are elite), and a stand-up comedian in denial. Thinks he looks like actor Vishal‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ the compressed version. Officially lives in Switzerland, though we strongly suspect he‚Äôs actually living in some refugee camp. Dramatic? Yes. Workaholic? For sure. Arshloc to his coworkers? Ask them (lmao). Carries his eternal optimism the way Ajith fans carry punch dialogues‚Äîloudly and proudly. Madly in love with Ajith Kumar, Arsenal FC, and somehow still surviving both. Certified Big Flirt‚Ñ¢. You‚Äôve been warned.',

				'Aka Yogi, Gangster Ganesh. Another Ajith fan (or ex-fan depending on his mood). A dedicated software engineer who only shows up to podcast sessions when we raise a Jira ticket. Strong opinions, plays devil‚Äôs advocate like it‚Äôs his side hustle, and is practical to the core. Would ditch tech life in a heartbeat to be an AD for Bala or Pa. Ranjith‚Äîbut only if Amma and Appa give full approval. Firm believer that movies must have a message (no ‚Äúmass for the sake of mass‚Äù here). Most likely to be spotted at a tea kadai.',

			description:
				'Aka Loosu Doctor Swathi. Always pretending to save lives on night shifts or posing at beaches, too "busy" for our podcast. Shows up once in a while to scream fake feminism and vanish. Calls herself a closeted Anil fan, but her cringey 2009 "Anna" fan page exposes it all. Moves like a thambi among the boys. Her unfiltered mouth could start a civil war, so we keep her appearances rare for public safety. She‚Äôll find the shadiest restaurant in every country she visits for an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äô‚Äô taste  ‚Äî eat at your own risk (and carry a pharmacy).',

				'Aka Sanja, blessed with the iconic Arjun Das voice. Lives in his own delulu world, but always with a touch of class. Certified Janhvi Kapoor stan (just check his IG likes, no further proof needed). Party animal with killer dance moves‚Äîcould clear a dance floor or steal the spotlight in seconds. Often mistaken for Varman from Jailer ‚Äì ‚ÄúManasalayoo??‚Äù included. Fun fact: he genuinely believed Parthiban was not Leo Das, even with Anirudh yelling ‚ÄúLeooooo‚Äù in full surround sound. A thideer Vijay fan post-Leo‚Ä¶ Good save us from these Anils.',

Also known as nidheshrajracing, part-time guitarist for rajboicovers, and enjoys getting punched (by his boxing coach, don‚Äôt worry). Currently busy plotting the rebrand of Wellawatte to Nidheshwatte. Rumored to be a silent heartthrob. Travel vlogs coming soon‚Ä¶ or never.',

						<br className='hidden sm:block' />
						<br className='hidden sm:block' />
						We're a gang with too many opinions, questionable
						priorities, and an unhealthy obsession with Kollywood,
						controversies, and cringe moments we secretly love. We
						talk in Tanglish, laugh too loud, and somehow manage to
						turn casual convos into full-blown episodes. Whether
						you're a Thalapathy stan, a Thala devotee, or someone
						who watches just for the songs ‚Äì we got something for
						you. From cinema debates to sneak diss fights to random
						side quests about life, this is your new favourite
						chaotic comfort zone.
